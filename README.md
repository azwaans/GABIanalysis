# GABI analysis
Scripts used for:
- the validation of the BEAST 2 package [GABI](https://github.com/azwaans/GABI), which implements the phylogenetic likelihood in [GAPML](https://github.com/matsengrp/gapml) (formulated in Feng et al., 2021: [Estimation of cell lineage trees by maximum-likelihood phylogenetics](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-1/Estimation-of-cell-lineage-trees-by-maximum-likelihood-phylogenetics/10.1214/20-AOAS1400.full)). 
- the analysis of GESTALT alignments for dome stage zebrafish data from McKenna et al., 2016: [Whole-organism lineage tracing by combinatorial and cumulative genome editing](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaf7907).
